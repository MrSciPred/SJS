#### SJS MULTIFUNCTIONAL LIBRARY ####

SJS is a repository containing a bunch of JavaScript, each designed for different tasks. It includes:
- Math, Geometry and Statistics: no need to worry about all those complicated operations, this'll do the job.
- ...and many more

The SJS Library is designed to work for multiple beginners (and possibly experts), ranging from reversing Arrays to Object Deep-freezing. You can create crazy things such as random generators to Universal Calculators, clipboard editing to duplication viruses (whoops). Unfortunately at this point the files are in their early stages, so waiting is required.
